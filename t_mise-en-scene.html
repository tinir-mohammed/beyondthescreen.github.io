        <h3>mise-en-scène</h3>

        <p>Mise-en-scène is the design aspect of a film’s production which can be
           used to convey the space and time of the film’s diegesis, the mood and
           theme, and also the character’s state of mind.
        </p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <h4 id="de">Décor</h4>
          <p>Décor refers to the objects within the setting of a scene.
        Décor can be used to convey the dominant theme and mood of a scene,
        and amplify characters’ emotions.</p>

          <p>In the movie Fanny and Alexander, the rich red and green interiors
            of Alexander’s grandmother’s house convey a feeling of warmth and
           homeliness, a space where Alexander feels safe and loved. On the other
           hand, the cold white interiors of his stepfather’s house is synonymous
           with the cold and distant way he feels towards his stepfather.</p>

          <p>In earlier years, rear projection was used to set films in exotic locations
             and sets which would have been difficult to recreate for economical, logistical,
             and safety reasons. In rear projection, action occuring in the foreground
             is combined with a background shot elsewhere, on location. This technique
             has been used to render scenes with stunts and more commonly, for scenes
             taking place in vehicles.</p>
          <p>North By Northwest (1959) uses rear projection in the scenes taking
            place in cars and trains, as well as for when the protagonist is attacked
            by a crop duster. </p>

        <h4 id="li">Lighting</h4>
          <p>Adjusting the direction, intensity, and quality of lighting can draw attention
             to certain parts of the scene’s composition, bring out colours in different ways,
             and can be be used to create the scene’s mood. Films like documentaries may
             use natural lighting for a touch of authenticity. However, most narrative films
             use what is known as the three-point lighting and variations of it.</p>
          <!-- <br> -->
        <h5> Three-point lighting </h5>
          <p>Three-point lighting consists of a backlight, which brings out the actor
            (or other object) from their background, a key light that highlights the
            actor, and a fill light from the opposite side that softens the key
            light’s shadow.</p>

            <img class="diagram" src="https://i.imgur.com/E76mwl9.jpg">

          <p> The following still from Life is Beautiful (1997) shows a standard
            use of three-point lighting illuminating Guido, the protagonist, in a
            balanced manner. </p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LG1k7az.png">
            <br>
            <h5> High-Key Lighting </h5>

            <p>Raising the fill light to the same level as the key light creates
               high-key lighting, which makes scenes brighter and with minimum shadows,
               as seen in the following still from the surrealist comedy The Discreet
               Charm of The Bourgeoisie (1972). High-key lighting sees greater use in
               comedies and musicals. </p>

               <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wo7Qvsi.png">

            <h5> Low-Key Lighting </h5>

            <p> Low-key lighting uses minimal fill light, resulting in high contrasts
                and dark shadows. This is used to create suspenseful and dramatic scenes
                seen in crime and drama. Low-key lighting is used extensively in
                The Godfather (1972), as seen below. </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/25Sm4oU.png">

            <hr>
            <h4 id="sp">Space</h4>
            <h5>Deep and Shallow Space </h5>
            <p>When important elements in the frame are placed near and far from the
              camera, the elements are said to be staged in <b>deep space</b>. The distance
              between the elements create a sense of depth. However, the elements do
              not all need to be in focus, which is necessary for what is known as deep
              focus. The opposite is staging in <b>shallow space</b>, in which key elements
              are placed so close to each other that there is little depth.
              </p>
            <p>In Psycho (1960), the position of Norman Bate’s house from the motel
            emphasises the distance that he is running. </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oTjAhP1.png">

            <h5> Frontality </h5>
            <p>Frontality refers to when key elements, most often actors, are placed
               face-to-face with the camera. This technique is not used frequently since
               it breaks the audience’s illusion that they are looking in on a separate
               world and implies that the characters are aware of being watched. Frontality
               is sometimes accompanied by direct address, in which a character looks at and
               addresses the audience. Direct address is a form of what is commonly known as “breaking the fourth wall”.
            </p>
            <p>Woodie Allen’s Annie Hall (1977) has many instances of frontality and direct
              addresses in which his character lets the audience in on his thoughts and takes
              them through the story.
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dP90Mzb.png">

            <h5> Matte Shot </h5>
            <p>Before the advent of special effects and computer generated imagery,
              the matte shot was a popular technique whereby two images were combined
              in a single image using an optical printer. Matte shots were used to
              add elements to realistic images, or to make fantastical scenes.
            </p>
            <p>Matte shots are found aplenty in Alfred Hitchcock’s films, like North by
            Northwest (1959). This shot of the interior of the UN Building is a
            combination of a matte painting and real-life images of people walking around.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GIMFDfx.png">

          <h5> Offscreen spaces </h5>
          <p>Offscreen spaces, as the term implies, are spaces that are out of the
            frame but are part of the film’s diegesis. Offscreen spaces are brought
            to the viewer’s attention when the characters on screen react to some
            other character or event happening offscreen, or by some offscreen sound.
            This can be used to create suspense in horror, crime, and drama films.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4 id="co">Costume</h4>
          <p>One of the most visible part of a mise-en-scène is costume. It is simply
            the clothes and makeup worn by the characters in a film. Costume can be
            used to signify the characters, the differences between characters, and help
            establish the era in which the film is set.</p>
          <p>In the film The Princess
          Bride (1987), the costumes of the characters play an integral role
          in creating the fantasy adventure diegesis of the film.</p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/czDV699.png">

          <hr>
          <h4 id="ac">Acting</h4>
          <p>Acting can be described as the most essential component of a film. To
            successfully translate the script to action, an actor needs a variety of skills:
            emotional range, physical expressivity, vocal projection, the ability to employ
            dialects and accents, and so on. Sometimes actors may also need training in
            specific skills for certain roles, like martial arts for an action film or
            singing for a musical.
          </p>
          <p>The following still shows Ralph Fiennes as the cruel
          and terrifying Amon Goeth in Schindler’s List (1993).</p>
