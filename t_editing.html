          <h3>editing</h3>
          <p>Editing is the process of combining disparate shots together to create
               relationships between them. Editing is essential to stitch shots together
                to construct the narrative time and space. Some forms of editing are
                discreet, while others more obvious.</p>

          <h4 id="de">Devices</h4>
          <h5>Transitions</h5>
          <h6>cheat cuts</h6>
            <p>A cheat cut is a type of continuity editting that purports to show continuous time and space from
              one shot to the next, but actually mismatches the positions of figures or objects in the scene.
              Cheat cuts were often employed to disguise the difference in the heights of shorter leading men and
              tall leading ladies.
           </p>
          <p>In the following series of stills from
            <span class="movie">Shadow Of A Doubt (1943)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, the extreme close-up of female
            protagonist’s hands holding the ring reveals the crucial writing inside the ring. But it does not
            match up with how she is holding the ring in the shots before and after this shot.
          </p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aEZQPWU.png">

            <h6>crosscutting</h6>
            <p>Crosscutting, also called parallel editing, alternates between shots from two or more lines of
              action occurring in different diegetic spaces, simultaneously. In most but not all cases, the lines
              of action are occuring at the same time. Crosscutting is used to connect the two events that are
              occurring and the characters therein.
            </p>
            <p>In this clip from
              <span class="movie">Snatch (2000)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, crosscutting is used to draw parallels between the coursing and
              Tyrone (Ade) being chased by two thugs, likening him to the hare and his pursuers to the greyhounds.
            </p>

            picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h6>cut-in and cut-away</h6>
            <p>A cut-in happens when we instantaneously shift from a distant view to a closer one, and vice-versa.
              In this scene from
              <span class="movie">A Man Called Ove (2015)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, a distant shot shows us the erratic driving of the car
              that others on the street see, while a cut-in reveals Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) in the car struggling
              to drive correctly under Ove’s (Rolf Lassgård) supervision.
            </p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sEc4EEa.png">

            <h6>dissolve</h6>
            <p>A dissolve is a transition from one shot to another brought about by fading out the first shot and
              fading in the next, such that for a moment the two shots are superimposed on each other. Dissolves
              can be used simply as a transitional element, or in more creative ways, such as to denote
              hallucinatory states or the passage of time.
            </p>
            <p> Dissolves are used in this sequence from
              <span class="movie">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> as the character looks
              for a tree and a package buried underneath it.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2D-Sqltav4"
             frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
             picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h6>Iris</h6>
            <p>An iris is a round, moving mask that closes in to end a scene or focus on a detail (iris-in),  or
              open out to reveal a scene or more space around a detail (iris-out).
             </p>
             <p>At the beginning of
               <span class="movie">Shock Corridor (1963)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, an iris-out is used to reveal to the audience the
               eponymous corridor, with the protagonist introducing himself in the voice over.
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z8q8rmBfdA" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>

            <h6>Establishing Shot/Re-establishing Shot</h6>
            <p>Establishing shots reveal to the audience the setting of a scene, the
               characters therein, and the relationships between them These are typically
               the first few shots of a scene and are taken in extreme long shots or
               long shots.
            </p>
            <p> The audience is introduced to the dry and hot Texas environs
            in some beautiful long shots at the very beginning of
            <span class="movie">No Country For Old Men (2007)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
            hence establishing the diegetic place of the film.
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vsgk5vm3lls"
               frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
               picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h6>Shot/Reverse Shot</h6>
            <p>In this form of editing, multiple scenes are edited together such
              that they show characters alternately, typically to show them and their
              reactions in a conversation situation. Shots such as over-the-shoulder
              shots, angled shots, and left/right alternating shots can be used to
              achieve shot/reverse shots.
            </p>
            <p> One example among many is illustrated by
            the following stills from
            <span class="movie">Léon: The Professional (1994)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> which show Léon
            (Jean Reno) conversing with Mathilda (Natalie Portman).
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/m4rJO3B.png">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoxNebA.png">

            <h6>Superimposition</h6>
            <p>Superimpositions are achieved by exposing multiple images on the same
               film strip. Superimpositions are not used for transitions (as in the
               dissolve) but for other creative purposes: to show the same actor playing
              two characters in the same frame, to express subjective or intoxicated
              vision, or to introduce other diegetic elements to the screen. </p>

              <p>In this (yet another!) example from
                <span class="movie">Citizen Kane (1941)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, newspaper
                headlines are superimposed on images of Kane’s wife performing to
                demonstrate the burgeoning ‘success’ of her singing career.
              </p>

              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uP21aUSdnqA"

              picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h5>Matches</h5>
            <p>Match editing, a major element of continuity editing, is used to draw
              connections between elements in subsequent shots. The connections are
              implied by the situation portrayed in the scene. When done well, match
              editing can produce a seamless cinematic experience.</p>

            <h6>Eyeline Match</h6>
            <p>In eyeline matches, the shots are edited such that the first shot shows
              a character looking at something, and the second cuts to what the character
              is looking at.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="movie">Cinema Paradiso (1988)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> contains many shots of cinema-goers
            eyeline matched with shots of the screen, to show what they are attentively
            watching.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZPKmZR4.png">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CalZvCG.png">

            <h6>Graphic Match</h6>
            <p>Graphic matching uses a similarity in some compositional element
              (like shape or colour) to achieve a smooth transition between two shots.
              Such matching can connect two otherwise disconnected scenes, or establish
              a relationship between two scenes.</p>
            <p>This clip from
              <span class="movie">Psycho (1960)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, showing an example of a graphic match,
              takes place right after Marion (Janet Leigh) has been stabbed in the shower.
              As the blood is washed away with the water, the camera focuses on the
              circular bathtub drain, which is then matched with her lifeless eye in
              the next shot.</p>
              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ydcWYYfciw"
              frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
              picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h6>Match on Action</h6>
            <p>A match on action edit cuts alternate views of the same action together
               at the same moment in order to make it seem uninterrupted. This allows
              the same action to be seen from multiple angles without breaking its
              continuous nature.
            </p>
            <p>In this clip from
              <span class="movie">Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, match
            on action editing provides a dynamic view of the fierce sword-fight
            between the Bride (Uma Thurman) and her adversary.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cALghSaKf8"

               picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h5>Duration</h5>
            <h6>Long Take</h6>
            <p>A long take, like the name suggests, is a shot that lasts longer than
              usual. Modern films have very small shot lengths, so any shot that lasts
              for more than a minute is generally considered a long take. These are
              usually taken with a moving camera and require choreography and rehearsal
              to get right.
            </p>
            <p>The famous Copacabana shot in
              <span class="movie">Goodfellas (1990)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> is a long shot that follows Henry
            (Ray Liotta) and his wife as he bypasses the regular entrance and leads
            her on an alternate path through the back kitchens in an assured, confident way.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AYTSY6VkzE"

            picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h6>Rhythm</h6>
            <p>Rhythm refers to the perceived rate and regularity of sounds, series of shots, and movements
              within the shots. The rhythm of a film is influenced by beat (or pulse), accent (or stress), tempo
              (or pace) etc. It is a combination of mise-en-scène, cinematography, sound, and editing, all of
              which contribute to the overall mood and effect of the film.</p>

            <p>The prelude to the final showdown of
              <span class="movie">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> runs for several
              minutes, as three men face each other in a triangle, waiting to see who will take the first step.
              One of the film’s theme songs is played in its entirety, from a slow, elegiac beginning to a frenzy
              crescendo that is abruptly cut off by the first gunshot. The slow mounting crescendo is paralleled
              by an increase in the editing rate.

            <h4 id="st">Styles</h4>
            <p>The patterned use of transitions, matches, and durations can give rise
               to identifiable editing styles which can be associated with technological
               developments, historical moments, and national schools.
            </p>
            <h5>Continuity Style</h5>
            <p>Continuity editing seeks to maintain clear and consistent narrative structure by matching screen
              direction, position, and temporal relations from shot to shot. It maintains the viewer’s assumption
              that space and time are contiguous between successive shots. This is done by adhering to the “180॰
              rule”, which is illustrated below. According to this rule, the camera must always remain on one side
              of the “axis of action”, i.e. an imaginary line drawn connecting the two major elements, usually the
              actors.</p>

              <p>The “180॰ rule” ensures that characters on screen occupy consistent positions on the screen,
                aiding the audience in understanding the layout of the scene. This is observed in the following
                scene from
                <span class="movie">The Godfather: Part II (1974)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.

              <h5>Elliptical Style</h5>
              <p>	In the elliptical editing style, subsequent shots omit parts of
                time, causing ellipses in the plot and diegetic time. One form of
                editing special to elliptical editing is the jump cut. The jump cut
                emphasises the constructed nature of film, which is opposite to the
                continuity style.
