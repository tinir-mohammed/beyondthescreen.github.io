        <h3>cinematography</h3>
        <p>Cinematography is the art of capturing the photographic images using a
           number of elements: quality, scale, framing and movement. These elements
           can be manipulated to influence how the audience perceives the scene being
            shot. For instance, the grainy black and white quality of
            <span class="movie">The Battle of Algiers (1966)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>
             lends an air of authenticity.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fUnw11l.png">

        <h4 id="qu">Quality</h4>
        <h5>Colour</h5>
          <p>Filmmakers in the earlier years were limited to only black-and-white,
            but advancements in technology allowed the use of colour in film. Colour
             can not only make a film more realistic and add glamour, but can be
             skilfully used to create aesthetic patterns and to establish character
             or emotion.</p>
            <p>In
              <span class="movie">Wings of Desire (1987)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, the cinematographer Henri Alekan has used
          black-and-white imagery to denote the angels’ point of view of the world,
             and colour imagery to show the human point view in which angels are not visible.
             Although the immortal angels see and hear everything, they are unable to partake
              in the joy and sadness of transient human life.</p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hF7Vny0.png">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NllvtHg.png">

          <h5>Contrast</h5>

          <p>Contrast is the ratio of the lightness to the darkness in an image.
            Low contrast, that is when the difference between the light and dark
             areas is little, is used to achieve natural lighting. High contrast,
             on the other hand, is usually used to create a dramatic effect in crime
             films and can be achieved with low-key lighting. A common cliche is using
             light and dark to represent good and evil respectively.
           </p>
           <p>In this still from
             <span class="movie">Schindler’s List (1993)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
             the protagonist is illuminated as he speaks
            to his factory workers, highlighting him as their saviour.</p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pGECZTx.png">

          <h5>Deep Focus and Shallow Focus</h5>
          <p>Deep focus is used to give equal importance to objects, actors, and
            spaces both near to and far from the camera. As seen in another still from
             <span class="movie">Citizen Kane (1941)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, deep focus is used to draw the audience’s
             attention towards young Charles Foster Kane as he plays outside the
             window while his parents discuss his fate indoors. </p>

             <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AFrsHXS.png">

             <p>The opposite of deep focus is shallow focus, which only brings into
                sharp focus one plane of the image, guiding the audience’s attention
                 to some particular element in the plane. This still from
                 <span class="movie">The Godfather (1972)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> shows how shallow focus is used to suggest psychological introspection,
                  as Al Pacino’s character becomes increasingly oblivious to his surroundings
                  and braces himself for what he is about to do next.
             </p>
             <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VbkcpLG.png">

          <h5>Racking Focus</h5>
          <p>Racking focus is the technique where the focus of the lens is changes
            such that an element in the scene goes out of focus and another comes
            into focus. This is used to direct an audience through the scene and also
            links two or more objects in the scene. This is observed in the following
            clip from
            <span class="movie">Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
            where racking focus is used to
            show the newsreel inspiring Bob Hoskin’s character’s Eureka moment.
          </p>

          frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
          picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <h5>Rate</h5>
          <p>A film is normally shot at 24 frames per second. However, if the number
             of frames per second, or the frame rate, is increased, then we can effect
              what we call slow motion.
          </p>
          <p>In this clip from
            <span class="movie">Reservoir Dogs (1992)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
          the main characters are shown in slow motion as we are introduced to
          them to make them appear cool and hip.</p>
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL4IQ33RiGY"
           frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
           picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

         <p>The opposite is also possible, i.e. decreasing the frame rate would effect
           fast paced motion. Frame rate can also be manipulated to achieve stop-motion,
           commonly seen in stop motion animation films like
           <span class="movie">Coraline (2009)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> and
           <span class="movie">Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.
        </p>

        <h5>Zoom Shoot</h5>
        <p>A zoom shot is achieved by changing the focal length of the lens that is
           used to take the shot, as the shot is being taken, so that it looks like
            we are getting closer to or farther away from the subject.
        </p>
        <p>The camera slowly zooms in on Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson)
          to emphasise his unhinged mental state and heighten tension, in
          <span class="movie">The Shining (1980)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICjn0qtfPUs"
         frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
         picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

         <hr>
        <h4 id="fr">Framing</h4>
        <h5>Angle of Framing</h5>

        <p>A shot taken from above or below the subject of the shot is said to be
          taken at an angle. An angled shot helps establish a relation between the
           subject and the camera’s point of view, or even a relation between two subjects.
        </p>
        <p> When Wesley (Cary Elwes) is arrested by Count Rugen (Christopher Guest) in
          <span class="movie">The Princess Bride (1987)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, the high angle shot
        of him makes him appear all the more defiant in his vulnerable position as a prisoner under
        the Count, who is shot from a low angle that emphasises his authority.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LozOWVR.png">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bEe1Ivl.png">

        <h5>Level of Framing</h5>
          <p>The level of framing is the height at which the camera takes a shot.
            Placing the camera near the ground achieves low-level framing, while
             placing it higher than the typical height produces high-level framing.
             Different levels of framing may be used to achieve pleasurable compositions
             or to draw the audience’s sympathy for characters, especially those at lower
              levels.</p>
          <p>Low-level framing is used in this still from
            <span class="movie">The White Balloon (1995)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>
          to evoke sympathy for the little girl who feels helpless in the midst of
          a crowd of men after having lost her money to a couple of snake charmers.</p>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMG3ltv.png">

            <h5>Canted Framing</h5>
            <p>In canted framing, also known as the dutch angle, the camera is not placed level;
              rather, one side is lower than the other. This causes
              the image to appear slanted. Canted framing is often used to signify
              danger and chaos.</p>
            <p>We see the dutch angle being used to frame Sgt. Donowitz (Eli Roth)
              and the German Sgt. Rachtman (Richard Sammel) in
              <span class="movie">Inglourious Basterds (2009)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, as the former prepares to bash the latter’s head with a club.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/E45m6iW.png" alt="Canted framing 1">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QNaWO1L.png" alt="Canted framing 2">

            <h5>Following Shot and Re Framing</h5>
          <p>  A following shot follows the subjects of the frame and keeps them
             onscreen by shifting the frame. The objective of such a shot is to keep
             the subjects of the frame at the centre of the audience’s attention.
             The camera may also slightly tilt or pan, that is reframe, to keep the
             subjects centered. An example is seen in this clip from
             <span class="movie">Get Out (2017)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>
              where the couple is followed by the frame.
          </p>

          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlIvXb9DkJM"
          frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
          picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h5>Point-of-View Shot </h5>

            <p>A point-of-view shot is taken by placing the camera approximately
              where the character’s eyes would be, giving us a view of what they are
              seeing in an unobtrusive manner. Point-of view shots may be preceded or
              succeeded by shots of the character to establish whose point of view we
              are looking at. This is one way of allowing the audience to identify
              with the characters on screen.</p>
            <p>A good example of this is the following
            scene from the gangster film
            <span class="movie">The Untouchables (1987)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, where we see a
            point-of-view shot of a knife-wielding thug breaking into Malone’s
            (Sean Connery) house.</p>
         <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sah1JTaun_U"
         frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
         picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h5> Wide-Angle Lens</h5>

            <p> Wide-angle lenses are short focal length lenses that emphasise the
              amount of space in a shot by distorting straight lines near the edge
              of the frame and exaggerating the distance between the foreground
               and background. This makes it convenient to use wide-angle lenses
               for shots of closed spaces like rooms with limited space.
           </p>
           <p> However, since wide-angle shots have distorted lines near the edges of the frame,
          it look less naturalistic in shots of close spaces and often find use
          in unrestrained open spaces with no lines near the edges. This
          shot from
          <span class="movie">Amélie (2001)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> demonstrates the use of a wide-angle lens in an open space.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YarBjza.jpg">

            <hr>
            <h4 id="sc">Scale</h4>
            <p>The scale of the object in the frame can influence how we perceive
              the object. The scale can either get us up close and intimate with the object,
              or make the object desolate and consumed by its surroundings.</p>
            <h5> Extreme Long Shot </h5>
            <p>An extreme long shot is one in which the scale of the object is tiny.
              Such shots can be of buildings, a landscape, a crowd of people, or any such scene.
              Extreme long shots are often used as establishing shots.</p>
            <p>This still from
              <span class="movie">The Lobster (2015)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> show us the picturesque setting in which the
              protagonist and his two acquaintances are sitting together and talking.</p>

            <h5> Long Shot </h5>
            <p>In a long shot, the scale of the objects shown is small. When there
              are people in the frame, they are usually shown head to toe within the
              frame, as seen in this image from
              <span class="movie">The White Balloon (1995)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>. This is a
              convenient shot that shows full-body action without the need to reframe,
              and hence finds common use in genres like musicals and action films.

           <h5> Medium Long Shot </h5>

          <p>A medium long shot has objects of four to five feet fill the screen
             entirely. Human subjects are shown from their head to their knees.
             Such shots are also called plain plan américain, because they found
            heavy use in westerns. Medium long shots were the closest you could
            get to an actor with their heads and holstered weapons within the frame.</p>
          <p> The following medium long shot is from Woody Allen’s
            <span class="movie">Annie Hall (1977)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.</p>

          <h5> Medium Close-Up </h5>
          <p>In a medium close-up, the scale of the object is large. Human subjects
            shown from the chest up will fill up the screen, as seen here in a still
            from the Norwegian film,
            <span class="movie">Headhunters (2011)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4PFvD8h.png">

            <h5>Close-Up</h5>
            <p>A close-up shows an object in quite a large scale. A person’s head,
            or some other object of similar size, would fill up the screen. A close-up
             does not necessarily have to include people, and can be of other objects as well.</p>
            <p>This still from the first sequence of
              <span class="movie">A Clockwork Orange (1971)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span> is a close-up of Alex
             (Malcolm McDowell) with an evil smirk on his face. This shot tells us from
             the get-go what a terrible person Alex is.</p>

          <h4 id="mo"> Movement </h4>
          <p>The motion of a camera can be fluid and smooth or it can be rapid and
            disorienting. Camera motions are used to allow the audience to take in
            a scene, follow the characters on screen, or even act as a way of
            effecting a transition between scenes.
          </p>

          <h5>Crane Shot</h5>
          <p>A crane shot is one that is taken by placing the camera on some
            crane-like device above the ground and sweeping it through the air
            in some direction. Crane shots are often those shots that cannot be
            easily achieved by a person. Crane shots may be used as establishing shots.
          </p>
          <p>The crane shot is used in a spectacular fashion in this clip from
            <span class="movie">Django Unchained (2012)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>
           to reveal to the audience the extent of the bloodbath and chaos of a massacre.</p>

            <h5> SteadiCam Shot </h5>
            <p>A Steadicam shot, or a handheld shot, is taken with a camera supported by the camera operator’s
              body who either holds it with their hands or uses a gyroscopic stabiliser and a harness.
              Although handheld cameras produce jerky and unstable images, the relative freedom afforded by them
              allow their use for motion tracking shots. Modern gyroscopic stabilisers minimise isolate the
              camera from the imperfections in the camera operator’s movements and allow smoother images.
            </p>
            <p>A handheld shot follows Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) in this scene from
              <span class="movie">Reservoir Dogs (1992)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
              as he steps out of the warehouse, heightening fear and trepidation about what he might do next to the
              policeman who is held in the warehouse.

          <h5> Pan </h5>
          <p>A camera is said to pan when it moves left or right and scans the
             space horizontally. A pan can be used to follow motion, reveal off-screen space,
              or even connect two or more objects in the scene. The speed of a pan may also
              be exploited for dramatic purpose. A pan may be accompanied by other motions
              like a zoom or movement of the camera base.
          </p>
          <p>In this scene from
            <span class="movie">North By Northwest (1959)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
            the camera pans away from Cary Grant’s character
            in the UN building to reveal a man who has tailed him into the building.</p>

          <h5>tilt</h5>
          <p>A tilt is like a camera pan, except the camera moves up or down, scanning space vertically.
            A tilt can be used to heighten tension and suspense as the audience does not know what the
            camera may uncover, or when the camera will stop. Tilts can be used, for example, to introduce
            characters, where the frame moves from the feet to the face to reveal the character’s identity
            in a suspenseful manner.
          </p>
          <p>A tilt here is used to mimic Andy Dufresne’s (Tim Robbins) point of view as he looks at the
            façade of the prison building and is taken into it, in
            <span class="movie">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.

          <h5>Tracking Shot</h5>
          <p>A tracking shot achieves a mobile framing that moves in some direction,
            following some action through space. There are a number of ways to achieve tracking shots:
            mounting the camera on a dolly, using tracks, or using a moving vehicle, that smoothly
            follows the action being filmed. Advances in steadicam technology also make it possible
            for handheld cameras to record spontaneous action.
          </p>
          <p>A pioneering use of the Steadicam for tracking action was in Stanley Kubrick’s
            <span class="movie">The Shining (1980)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.
            The Steadicam in this case was placed on a mount modeled on a wheelchair to take this famous
            tracking shot of Danny pedalling throughout the Overlook Hotel:

          <h5>Whip Pan</h5>
          <p>A whip pan is a rapid motion of a camera to one side, so rapid that the images become blurry
            streaks of lines. Whip pans are used to effect transitions between scenes and may also be used
            to denote rapidly unfolding events. Whip pans stand out due to their rapid and flashy nature,
            and find common use in action or comedy films, as seen in this clip from
            <span class="movie">Shaun of The Dead (2004)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.
