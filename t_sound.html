        <h3>sound</h3>
        <p>Everybody knows that first there was silent film and then there was sound.
          Without sound a movie would have very little meaning. It would not grab
          the audience’s attention or evoke their emotion, it would just be a
          dragging motion picture of people talking. Therefore, sound is used
          extensively in filmmaking to enhance presentation, and is distinguished
          into two broad type, namely diegetic and nondiegetic sound:
        </p>

        <h4 id="di"> Diegetic sound</h4>

        <p>It is sound that the characters can hear as well as the audience, and usually implies a reaction from
          the character. Diegetic sound is also called "literal sound" or "actual sound". These include voices
          of characters, sounds made by objects in the diegesis (like the heartbeat of a person), basic sound
          effects (like a dog barking, a car passing, the radio playing, or a character coughing), and source
          music i.e. sounds coming from instruments (record players, radios, tape players etc.) in the diegetic
          space.
        </p>
        <p> The following clip from The Dark Knight (2008) has instances of diegetic sound, which include the
          voices of the Joker, Batman, and other characters.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h4 id="no">Non-diegetic sound</h4>
        <p>It is sound which is represented as coming from a source outside the story space, i.e. its source is
          neither visible on the screen, nor has been implied to be present in the action. Non-diegetic sound
          is also called "non-literal sound" or "commentary sound". These include a narrator's commentary,
          Voice of God, sound effect added for dramatic effect, mood music, and film score. Non-diegetic sound
          plays a significant role in creating the atmosphere and mood within a film.
        </p>
        <p>College & Electric Youth's song A Real Hero is the background score, and a non-diegetic sound,
           in this scene from Drive (2011).
        </p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="vo">Voice Over</h4>

          <p>When a voice, often that of a character in the film, is heard while we see an image of a space and
            time in which that character is not actually speaking. The voice over is often used to give a sense
            of a character’s subjectivity or to narrate an event told in flashback. It is overwhelmingly
            associated with genres such as film noir, and its obsessive characters with a dark past. It is
            usually pre-recorded in a studio and then played over in the film.
           </p>
          <p> An example of a voice-over can be found in the following clip from Sunset Boulevard (1955),
            introducing us to the eponymous boulevard and providing an insight into what we are seeing.
          </p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="th">Theme Music</h4>
          <p>A recognisable piece of music written specifically for a film and is
            usually played during the intro, opening credits and/or ending credits.
            The purpose of a theme song is often similar to that of a leitmotif.The
            theme music for the franchise of Ghostbusters (1984) and Jurassic Park
            (1993) are among the most recognisable and popular ones.
          </p>
          <p>The theme music from Ghostbusters (1984) is arguably one of the most famous ones that is
          instantly recognisable.</p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="ex">Exaggerated/Pleonastic sound</h4>
          <p>Directors often use exaggerated sound to heighten emotion or meaning
              in a scene. Using sound in this way can suggest an incoming threat
              before the audience sees it. It can be used to reinforce a character’s
              threatening nature when they are present on screen. It can also help
              to emphasise the emotional impact of a specific action taking place on screen.
             </p>
             <p>The sound of Chris's (Daniel Kaluuya) heartbeat is exaggerated in this clip from Get Out (2017)
             to underscore his fear and trepidation.</p>
             <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3uGJYzAOEo"
              frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
               picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <hr>
            <h4 id="so">Sound effects</h4>
            <p>Sound effects and background noises (like the sound of footsteps and rain falling) are integral
              in giving a sense of reality to the world depicted in a film. Sound effects can equally be used to
              increase mystery, suspense and disorientation for the viewer, like in the science fiction and
              horror genres.
            </p>
            <p>The sound of rainfall is a sound effect that adds to the sombre feel in the following clip
               from John Wick (2014) that takes place on the day of a funeral.
            </p>

            picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h5>Foley Sound</h5>
            <p>Foley sound takes its name from Jack Foley, a sound editor at Universal
              Studios. Foley sound is live action sound recreated in a studio, using
              a variety of different everyday objects and surfaces, like the sound of drawing on paper with pencil.
