        <h3>basic terms</h3>
        <h4 id="au">Auteur</h4>
          <p>The term auteur is the French word for “author”. In the context of
            cinema, it refers to a filmmaker who exerts a high level of stylistic
            control and autonomy over their projects, resulting in movies that are
            “stamped” with their personality. An auteur is known for their recognizable
            style or thematic preoccupations. A film auteur is akin to the author of a
            novel or the artist of a painting. An auteur is described in contrast to a
            “metteur en scene,” who translates a story in another medium to film.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson is a contemporary auteur, who uses symmetrical visuals,
            primary-colour palettes, offbeat characters and touches of absurdity
            to create movies that are distinctly his.
          </p>

        <h4 id="di">Diegesis</h4>
          <p>Diegesis refers to the world created in a film by the objects, events,
            spaces, and characters of the film. These not only include the events
            we see unfolding and the characters we see onscreen, but also the events
            that occur before and after the events of the film, characters that do
            not explicitly appear in the screen, as well as other things and attitudes
            that we infer from the film and use to construct its diegetic world.</p>

          <p>In this scene from <span class="movie">Psycho (1960)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster" src=""><span class="details"></span></span></span>
            , the sound of the car being driven
            is a diegetic sound that happens in the world of the film, while the
            musical score accompanying the scene is a non-diegetic sound that
            only the audience hears.</p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="fl">Flashbacks and Flashforwards</h4>
          <p>Flashbacks and flashforwards are when the movie jumps back and forwards
             in diegetic time. When flashbacks or flashforwards are used, the order
             of the events presented in the film no longer match the actual order
             of events in its diegetic world. </p>

          <p><span class="movie">Citizen Kane (1941)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster" src=""><span class="details"></span></span></span>
             is perhaps the best known film that almost
            entirely uses flashbacks to tell its story. It follows a reporter as
            he tries to piece together the titular character’s life by interviewing
            several people from his life.The stills below show the character of
            Jedediah Leland, played by Joseph Cotten, who appears in the film both
            as an old Jedediah recounting past events as well as a young
            Jedediah working with Kane.</p>

          <h4 id="ge">Genres</h4>
          <p>Genres refer to categorisation of films based on shared stylistic
            elements, narratives, characters, and conventions. Genres have been
            made necessary by the large numbers of films produced by the film
            industry. Main genres like drama, comedy, and action can be further
            divided into subgenres like courtroom drama, romance, and spoofs. </p>

          <p>The following stills are from the drama film <span class="movie">Manchester By The Sea (2016)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>, and the crime film <span class="movie">Drive (2011)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>.</p>

          <h4 id="mi">Mise-en-Scène</h4>
          <p><a class="inlinelink tbtn" href="t_mise-en-scene.html">Mise-en-Scène</a>, French for “placing on stage,” refers to all that is
            placed in front of the camera and that forms part of a scene’s setting:
            from the lighting, composition, décor, and props, to the actors,
            their make-up, their costumes, and their performance. These elements
            are manipulated by filmmakers to convey the space and time as well
            as a mood and vibe. </p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="st">Story and Plot</h4>
          <p>Often used interchangeably, plot refers to the events of the film
            that occur in front of the camera and are seen by the audience, while
            story refers to everything about the film’s diegesis that an audience
            infers from viewing the plot of the film. The story of a film is hence
            more extensive than the plot of the film. The order, duration, setting
            of the events presented in the film are all part of the plot that a
            filmmaker can manipulate in order to convey the story. </p>

          <p>Christopher Nolan engages the viewers of his film <span class="movie">Memento (2000)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>
            by making them piece together the story from a plot that is delivered
            in a reverse chronological order. </p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="sc">Scene and Sequence</h4>
          <p>A scene is a segment of a film that conveys a few lines of action
            taking place in a single time and place, and with the same characters.
            A scene may also occur in different spaces or time, related by
            crosscutting. A sequence can be used to mean the same as a scene,
            but a sequence can also be longer and spread out over different
            spaces and times, like a montage sequence.</p>
          <p>The following is an instance of a montage from
            <span class="movie">Fight Club (1999)<span class="minfo"><img class="poster"><span class="details"></span></span></span>,
             showing members of the eponymous club do their "homework".</p>

          <hr>
          <h4 id="sh">Shot</h4>
          <p>A shot, the basic unit of cinema, refers to a single continuous stream
          of images uninterrupted by editing. A film is made up of hundreds of shots
          that are stitched together to create scenes and sequences, which in
           turn create the film.</p>
